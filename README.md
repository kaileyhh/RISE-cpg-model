### Direction / Purpose
Explore chaos or bifurcations

Implications - 2 modalities / states in which the system can exist

#### Specific Steps:

Model the chaotic behavior in a hindmarsh-rose neuron: analyze phase-space, bifurcations, and firing rates

Develop biologically inspired CPG circuits using the hindmarsh-rose neurons (inhibitory, excitatory, complex circuits)

Model a biological mechanism by developing an original CPG circuit
